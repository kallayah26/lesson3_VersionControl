            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Version control (VC) is every IT/ICT studentâ€™s best friend. It allows all versions of a project or code to be revisited after newer versions have been made. I am very interested in Version Control because I would like to go into web design and VC would be a great tool to have when working on tweaks throughout the creation and maintenance of a website. I plan on thoroughly understanding VC in order to use it to its full advantages. This tool is relevant to our course because it is going to allow us to keep track of all of the versions of each of the projects we will work on throughout the semester. It will be the most beneficial for the published projects we create because we will be able to revert to previous versions without missing a beat. </p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">For starters Git and Github are two separate things. Both however will be useful to us in this class. Git evolved from BitKeeper. The creators wanted to make a new tool that was fast, simple and strong. Git is all of these things and then some. Git was created in 2005 based on the foundation of the three characteristics that were just named. I am interested in Git because I would like to know the relationship between Github and git considering they share the same name. This topic is relevant to LIS2360 because we should know the history behind the tools that we utilize during our time in this class and beyond. </p>

                <span class="text-muted">Git Basics</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Git serves as a version control database of sorts. It relies heavily on the use of local operations to do its job. All versions of a project are saved on the local disk when using Git. This allows users to make commit changes without wireless connection, which adds to the convenience of this tool. Git has amazing integrity features that protect files from corruption and getting lost. This helps preserve the time and work it takes to create your projects. I am interested in the basics of Git because it helps to understand the functions of a tool that I may be using to do some of the work for this course. It is relevant to LIS2360 because we are going to be using it to preserve our web apps during our time in this class. </p>

                <span class="text-muted">Getting a Git Repository</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">There are two ways to obtain a Git repository; turn a local directory into a Git repository or clone a Git repository that is already made. For this class we had to turn a local directory into a Git repository by connecting it to our Github account. The Set up process looks different for different PC devices, but ultimately they all serve the same purpose. The main git command is git init, this is used at the very beginning of the set up process and from there it is a matter of following a few other commands. I am interested in this because I just recently had to set up my first git repository and did it incorrectly, knowing this info is useful for future success. This course is going to rely heavily on the process of getting a git repository, we will have to do it for every assignment from here on out. </p>

                <span class="text-muted">Getting started with GitHub</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Creating a GitHub account is super easy and even more beneficial. GitHub serves as a host for the git repositories created over time for individual users. It allows users to have a place for their work to be found upon completion and up keep of published work. All you need is an account name, email address and password to create an account. Once those are established GitHub is what you make of it. I am interested in GitHub because I believe that it will help me show case my capabilities at the completion of this course. GitHub is beneficial to everyone in LIS2360 because it is going to help us preserve, edit and store our creations. </p>
